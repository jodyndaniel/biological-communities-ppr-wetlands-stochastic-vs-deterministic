# Stochastic and deterministic processes drive wetland community assembly cross a gradient of environmental filtering
  
For this publication, I used sampling without replacement to deal with our unbalanced designed. We measured alpha (number of taxonomic groups per wetland), gamma (number of taxonomic groups per wetland class) and beta (how an individual wetland differed from all other wetlands in the taxonomic groups it supported) diversity. We also tested whether there was a difference in diversity based on wetland class.

We were also interested in whether our measured beta diversity was differed from what we would expect by chance.

The data used in this publication are in xlsx format: 1) sheet 1 -  site information; 2) sheet 2 - bird abundances; sheet 3 - plant cover; and 4) aquatic macroinvertebrate abundances.

In the code folder are the functions used to run the analyses.

Check out our publication for more details.
